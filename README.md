This repo is used for submiting the Cypress101 assignment 2.
To run the tests simply type "lambdatest-cypress run".

Scenario1 passes locally but Scenario2 fails, this is because cypress axe finds acessibility issues on the lambdatest playground website.

All test fail on the lambdatest cloud due to npm dependency errors. I contacted your tech support and they provided me with the following information: "This is probably an issue with the project or the dependencies, please reffer to this guide for running cypress tests on lambdatest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xwnHjYrJ4M".

The video provided no solution to my problem, I would once again like to ask for help as I believe there must be a solution to such an important part of cypress testing.
